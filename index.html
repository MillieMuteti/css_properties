            Thereâ€™s never a dull moment! The developments since I got into the industry are astonishing.
            IT is a great career for problem solvers and dreamers like me and when they team up, the magic happens! The feeling of working towards a solution that forges a new path, or of unravelling a problem that has drawn upon our combined knowledge and expertise is tremendously satisfying.
            technology is an industry that rewards the innovators and hard workers. For anyone with curiosity, work ethic and a drive to help customers get more from technology, the opportunities are endless. And for those youngsters wondering what their future might hold, chances are, whatever they choose, it will involve technology in one way or another.

        <h3>What I have learnt so far</h3>

        <h3>Importance of CSS</h3>
        <p>
            CSS is a styling language used for website layout in design and used alongside HTML.
            CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

        <h2>The differences between paddings, borders and margins</h2>
        <p>
            The main difference between padding and margin is that padding controls how much breathing room exists within a box, 
            while margin controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a box. 
        <br>        
            Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can change its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box. 

            Margins, on the other hand, are essentially invisible barriers around a box. They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen.<br>
            Margins can be set to zero and above like padding. But unlike padding, margins can also be set to auto and can even have negative values.<br>
            Border on the other hand creates a border between the padding and the margin of an element.It has different CSS properties such as size, radius, style and color.<br><br>
